\section{Methods}

Here we give a description of data cleaning/preprocessing measures, the model selection 
process in an unsupervised learning setting, and finally a detailed analysis of the 
graph formation and structure. 


\subsection{Data Processing}

\stuTodo{Refer to figures for compilation of data sources}. 
Details we need to cover
\begin{itemize}
    \item data was scaled using standard scaler 
    \item categorical varaibles were one hot encoded 
    \item projected into two dimensions using UMAP (ignore hyperparameter selection, 
    it will be alluded to later)
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Model Generation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Brief overview of how mapper works coverings + local HDBSCAN + node formation + edge formation
    \item Topological meaning of being in the same node (or sharing an edge)
    \item Meaning of paths and connected components in a graph 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Model Selection}

\begin{itemize}
    \item
