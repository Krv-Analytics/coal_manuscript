    \textbf{(a)} A generator-level \textit{What-If} timeline of retiring US coal capacity, making the assumption that coal plants with no planned retirements will retire at 50 years old (see SI.\ref{fig:gen-ages} for an understanding of why this what-if scenario is not realistic).
    The 50 year old retirement age comes from the average age of retirement of a coal plant in the US, and is supported by Grubert's assertion that most coal capacity will retire when it reaches the age of 50...
    Regardless, this still leaves us shy of climate targets and hinges very heavily on a large amount of coal capacity retiring very quickly.
    \textbf{(b)} A breakdown of retirement rates needed to hit climate targets versus the current rate of coal retirements in the US.
